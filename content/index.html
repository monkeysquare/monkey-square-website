      <h1><strong>Past Event</strong>Monospace<sup>11</sup></h1>
      <p>We resuscitated the Monospace Conference and over 125 developers made it a huge success! We provided these developers a unique look at running their applications across all the platforms using Microsoft's .NET Framework by focusing on the Mono framework and open source .NET technologies.</p>

        <h2>What is Monkey Square</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Monkey Square is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization with no hidden agenda to evangelize cross platform and open-source development in .NET. Monkey Square is the parent organization of the annual MonkeySpace Conference and is a visible presence and point of contact for corporate sponsors interested in supporting the conference and other open-source .NET activities.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to bring some structure to a fragmented ecosystem by helping to fund open-source .NET development and by funding special projects. Only together can we change the culture around our ecosystem.</p>
