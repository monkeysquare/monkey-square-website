      <h1><strong>About</strong>Monkey Square</h1>
      <p>Monkey Square is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization with no hidden agenda to evangelize cross platform and open-source development in .NET. Monkey Square is the parent organization of the annual MonkeySpace Conference and is a visible presence and point of contact for corporate sponsors interested in supporting the conference and other open-source .NET activities.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to bring some structure to a fragmented ecosystem by helping to fund open-source .NET development and by funding special projects. Only together can we change the culture around our ecosystem.</p>

      <p>We're just five guys who want to leave the .NET open-source ecosystem better than they found it. Monkey Square was founded with the goal of promoting open-source development in .NET. We remain committed to the empowerment of our users, and are always looking for ways to improve our ecosystem. We want people to be safe, in control, and enriched by the software they use whether it was developed by Microsoft or you.</p>
